# Load Document

Loading document: $ARGUMENTS

Using `rlm_load_document(path="$ARGUMENTS")`

This loads the full raw content of a single document from your Snipara project. Returns the file content along with line count and token count metadata.

**Plan required:** PRO or higher.

**When to use:**
- You need the exact content of a specific file (not a search result)
- You want to inspect a document before editing it
- You need raw content rather than search-ranked excerpts
